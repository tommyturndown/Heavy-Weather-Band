<h1> The Heavy weather Band </h1>

Overview.

My project is a website for a 1960's rock band.
The Heavy Weather Band has had 50 year's experience playing at different events both nationally and internationally, and they're still very well known around Europe and North America.
Their target audience nowadays are music festivals, community events,barndances,weddings and other events such as christmas parties, birthday parties,retirements etc. They're still going strong
and have lost none of their popularity, and they would like a modern, rich website to showcase their talents and to generate revenue to suppliment their income. 

UX

On the landing page, the user is met with a concert scene with red glowing stage and the crowd in the foreground.I found this free image using Google Advanced Search.
The scene is of an indoor conceret/event.Each page has that same background to ensure continuity.

The callout container under the navigation bar bears the name of the band,"The Heavy Weather band and their logo;"You've got a stormfront comin'..".
The name of the band uses the jumbotron callout container to immediately grab attention with the logo in smaller italic text underneath. Both texts are in white with a red /black image 
in the background.

Features

Existing features

With the mobile-first design in mind, the user has a dropdown menu at the top of the screen that has links to the Home, About, Playlist,Gallery, Reviews and Contact pages.
On the medium and larger desktop screens, the navigation bar is spread across the top of the page with the various links turning to white when hovered.


On the main body of the homepage,there are three initial features with links. The first is an invitation to attend a band showcase, where the user can attend a live recording 
of one of the band's performances in-studio in Limerick. There's a default button to bring the user to Google Calendars (TM) to pre-book the show.

The second feature is a link to some video and audio content belonging to the band.

the third feature is a link to the Reviews page.

All three links are accessed by a default button set in orange to compliment the image in the background.

Under the three main features lies a fourth feature- an iframe with a promotional video of the band playing at various events such as weddings,retirements and christmas parties etc.

The fifth feature, which is vivible on medium and larger screens only, is an action shot of The Heavy Weather Band performing live on stage, with the lead singer interacting with the crowd.

The footer element contains a row of social links, linking the user to the band's social media pages including Facebook,Instagram,Twitter,Pinterest and YouTube.
On larger screens, there is also The Wedding band association logo and a link to the band's IMRO licence, which are not as commercially sensitive.
There were no wireframes or mockups used in this project, although I drew my inspiration from "The Great Escape Wedding Band" and their website.

Pages.

The About page gives a brief history of the band, what kind of music they play, and what kind of audience they're targeting. I made up this text myself from reading similiar websites.

The playlist page is a list of well-known songs in the band's repetoire, displaying the names of the artists and of the songs which the band plays cover versions.

The Gallery page is a collection of photographs of the band playing on-stage with the crowd in the foreground. The caption under each of the images is of various events that the band have
performed at.

The Reviews page is made up of testimonials from previous satisfied customers, with personal tributes to The Heavy Weather Band.

Finally, the Contact page has a default contact request form whereby the user supplies their name,email, phone number and the type of event they're planning.
