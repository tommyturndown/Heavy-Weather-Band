<h1> The Heavy weather Band </h1>

On the landing page, the user is met with a concert scene with red glowing stage and the crowd in the foreground.I found this free image using Google Advanced Search.
The scene is of an indoor conceret/event.

The callout container under the navigation bar bears the name of the fictional band,"The Heavy Weather band and their fictional logo;"You've got a stormfront comin'..".
The name of the band uses the jumbotron callout container to immediately grab attention with the logo in smaller text underneath. Both texts are in white with the red /blackimage 
in the background.

For marketing purposes, the main article has three w3 cards readily visible under the callout section.-. ,---.   ,--.,------.  ,------.
    '  .--./|  | ,---. ,--.,--. ,-|  || o   \  |  ||  .-.  \ |  .---'
